Debug Interfaces
----------------

The |DEVICE| platform supports the cJTAG (2-wire) and JTAG (4-wire)
interfaces. Any debuggers that support cJTAG, like the TI XDS100v3
and XDS200, work natively. Others interfaces, like the IAR I-Jet and
Segger J-Link, can only be used in JTAG mode but their drivers
inject a cJTAG sequence which enables JTAG mode when connecting. The
hardware resources included on the devices for debugging are listed
as follows. Not all debugging functionality is available in all
combinations of debugger and IDE.

-  Breakpoint unit (FBP) – 6 instruction comparators, 2 literal
   comparators

-  Data watchpoint unit (DWT) – 4 watchpoints on memory access

-  Instrumentation Trace Module (ITM) – 32 × 32 bit stimulus registers

-  Trace Port Interface Unit (TPIU) – serialization and time-stamping of
   DWT and ITM events

The SmartRF06 Board contains a XDS100v3 debug probe, and the CC2650
LaunchPad contains the XDS110 debug probe. These debuggers are used
by default in the respective sample projects.

Connecting to the XDS Debugger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If only one debugger is attached, the IDE uses it automatically when you click
the |img_icon_debug_ccs| button in CCS or |img_icon_debug_iar| in IAR.

If **multiple debuggers** are connected, you must choose the individual
debugger to use. The following steps detail how to select a debugger in CCS
and IAR.


Configuring Debugger in CCS
---------------------------

When multiple debuggers are attached, and a CCS debugging
session is started, CCS will prompt user to select the
debugger to utilize.

To select a specific debugger in CCS for every session, do as follows:

Find Serial Number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To find the serial number for XDS110 or XDC 100v3 debuggers, do as follows.

1. Open a command prompt.

2. Run ``C:\ti\ccsv6\ccs_base\common\uscif\xds100serial.exe`` to get
   a list of serial numbers of the connected debuggers.

For XDS110 debuggers (LaunchPads), run the following command: ``c:\ti\ccsv6\ccs_base\common\uscif\xds110\xdsdfu.exe -e``

Configure Serial Number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

=======================================    ===============================================
1. Open the target configuration file.     .. image:: resources/ccs_targetconfig_file.png
2. Open the Advanced pane.
3. Choose the top-level debugger entry.    .. image:: resources/ccs_targetconfig_probe.png
4. Enter the serial number.                .. image:: resources/ccs_targetconfig_serial.png
=======================================    ===============================================


Configuring Debugger in IAR
---------------------------

To debug using IAR, do as follows.

1. Open the project options (Project -> Options)
2. Go to the Debugger entry.
3. Go to Extra options.
4. Add the following command line option:
   ``--drv_communication=USB:#select``

Adding this command line option makes the IAR prompt which debugger
to use for every connection.
