Developing with IAR
===================

Installing IAR
--------------

The IAR toolchain contains many features beyond the scope of this document.
More information and documentation can be found at `IAR.com <www.iar.com>`_.

Check the |BLESTACKVER| release notes to see which IAR version to use and any
required workarounds. Object code produced by IAR may differ in size and
performance as compared to CCS produced object code.

The following procedure describes installing and configuring the correct version
of IAR and the necessary tools.

#. Install IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM

    `Download and install IAR EW ARM <https://www.iar.com/iar-embedded-workbench/partners/texas-instruments/ti-wireless/>`_

    To get IAR, choose one of the following methods:

        - Download the IAR Embedded Workbench 30-Day Evaluation Edition –
          This version of IAR is free, has full functionality, and
          includes all of the standard features. The size-limited
          Kickstart evaluation option is not compatible with this SDK.

        - Purchase the full-featured version of IAR Embedded Workbench – For
          complete BLE application development using the |DEVICE|, TI
          recommends purchasing the complete version of IAR without any
          restrictions. You can find the information on purchasing the complete
          version of `IAR <https://www.iar.com/buy>`_.

    .. attention::
        The version required is stated in the release notes.
        Opening IAR project files with a previous version of IAR may cause
        project file corruption.


#. Show Build Messages

    TI recommends showing all the build output messages for full verbosity
    during building. To do this, go to **Tools** -> **Options** and set
    **Show Build Messages** to **All**
    (see :numref:`fig-show-all-build-messages`)

    .. _fig-show-all-build-messages:
    .. figure:: resources/image15.png
        :align: center

        Show All Build Messages in IAR

.. Comment this out. Not very useful at the moment.
    #. Verify Custom Argument Variables

        Verify Custom Argument Variables points to the installed XDCtools path set
        by XDCROOT (see :numref:`fig-custom-argument-variables`).

        .. _fig-custom-argument-variables:
        .. figure:: resources/image17.jpeg
            :align: center
            :width: 75%

            Custom Argument Variables

        .. note::
            If any additional argument groups on the Workspace or Global tabs are
            present that conflict with the CC26xx TI-RTOS group, disable the groups.
            If these tools are installed to a non-default location, these variables
            must be manually updated.

Opening |BLESTACK| IAR Projects
-------------------------------

This section describes how to open and build an existing project and references
the simple\_peripheral project. All of the |BLESTACK| projects included in the
development kit have a similar structure.

.. error::
    If you have imported the global
    ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/tools/iar/SIMPLELINK_CC13XX_CC26XX_SDK.custom_argvars``
    as described in :ref:`sec-importing-tidrivers-iar-projects`,
    then |BLESTACK| examples will fail to build. For |BLESTACK| examples,
    you must remove this custom_argvars file from your IAR global custom
    arguments.

#. Open the IAR Embedded Workbench IDE from the Start Menu.
#. Open an IAR workspace project: **File** -> **Open** -> **Workspace...**

    - For this example, select
      *<SDK\_INSTALL\_DIR>\\examples\\rtos\\CC2640R2_LAUNCHXL\\ble5stack\\simple\_peripheral\\tirtos\\iar\\ble5\_simple\_peripheral.eww*

.. sidebar:: IAR Workspace Pane

    .. _fig-iar-workspace-pane:
    .. figure:: resources/iar_workspace_pane.png
        :align: center
        :width: 75%

        IAR Workspace Pane

This workspace file is for the simple\_peripheral project. When selected, the
files associated with the workspace become visible in the Workspace pane on the
left side of the screen. See :numref:`fig-iar-workspace-pane`

Select either project as the active project by clicking the respective tab at
the bottom of the workspace pane. In :numref:`fig-iar-workspace-pane`, the
Overview tab is selected. This tab displays the file structure for both projects
simultaneously. In this case, use the drop-down menu at the top of the workspace
pane to select the active project. Each of these projects produces a separate
downloadable object. The simple\_peripheral sample project is the primary
reference target for the description of a generic application in this guide. The
simple\_peripheral project implements a basic |BLESTACK| peripheral device
including a GATT server with GATT services. This project can be a framework for
developing peripheral-role applications.

|BLESTACK| IAR project build configurations
-------------------------------------------

This and all |BLESTACK| project workspaces contain various projects and build
configurations as shown in :numref:`tbl-inc-developing-in-iar-build-configs`
\*\_StackLibrary build configurations build the stack as a library as
described in :ref:`sec-inc-architecture-stack-image-as-a-library`.

.. _tbl-inc-developing-in-iar-build-configs:
.. table:: Available IAR project build configurations

    +--------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+

    +--------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+


Compile and Download
--------------------

For all build configurations, the stack project should always be built before
the application project.

For projects where the stack is built as a **library**:

    #. Build the stack library project.

        - Select the stack project.
        - Select **Project** -> **Make** to build the stack.

    #. Build the application project.

        - Select the application project.
        - Select **Project** -> Make to build the application.

    #. Load the whole application

        - To download and debug: Select **Project** -> **Download and Debug**
        - To download without debugging: Select **Project** -> **Download** ->
          **Download Active Application**

    .. note::
        Application project that consume the stack in a library form will not
        have hard defined image boundaries.

        After the initial build, if the stack project is not modified, only the
        application project needs to be rebuilt.

For projects where the stack and application are **split images** (not a library):

    #. Build the stack project.

        - Select the stack project.
        - Select **Project** -> **Make** to build the stack.

    #. Build the application project.

        - Select the application project.
        - Select **Project** -> Make to build the application.

    #. Load the stack project.

        - Select **Project** -> **Download** -> **Download Active Application**
          to download the stack project.

    #. Load the application project.

        - To download and debug: Select **Project** -> **Download and Debug**
        - To download without debugging: Select **Project** -> **Download** ->
          **Download Active Application**

    .. note::
        The stack project defines the flash and RAM boundary parameters used by
        the application project. Any modifications to the stack project require
        a rebuild of the stack project, followed by a rebuild of the application
        project to use the new boundary settings. See :ref:`sec-fontier-tool`.

        After the initial build, if the stack project is not modified, only the
        application project needs to be rebuilt.

        When the application is downloaded (that is, flash memory programmed),
        you can debug without reflashing the device. Go to **Project** ->
        **Debug without Downloading**.

.. caution::
    Do not modify the CPU Variant in the project settings. All sample projects
    are configured with a CPU type, and changing this setting (that is, from
    |DEVICE|) may result in build errors.

Sample applications that implement the Over the Air Download (OAD) firmware
update capability require the Boot Image Manager (BIM) project to be built.
Refer to the :ref:`sec-oad` section for more details.

.. _sec-importing-tidrivers-iar-projects:

Importing TI Drivers IAR Projects
---------------------------------

Unlike the IAR projects for the |BLESTACK|, IAR projects for ``TI Drivers`` must
be imported rather than opened. All TI Drivers project are created from the
original sources in ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/drivers``. Because of this
difference, you **must not** open ``TI Drivers`` .eww IAR projects directly from
within the SDK.

Here are the steps on how to import a `TI Drivers` project.

.. error::
   **Do NOT try to open the .eww projects in**
   ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/drivers`` **directly in IAR!**

   Doing so will cause IAR to generate project files directly in the example you
   opened. The result of this is a project that does not open the correct source
   files and if you try to import the project afterwards with the import
   procedures listed below, not all source files will be imported into the
   project!

#. Open the version of IAR that is stated in the release notes.
#. Globally import the .custom_argvars file provided by the |SDK|:

   #.  Select **Tools** -> **Configure Custom Argument Variables**

       .. figure:: resources/iar_global_custom_vars.png

           Configuring Custom Argument Variables

   #.  Select the **Global Tab** and click on the **Import** button

       .. figure:: resources/iar_global_imports.png

           Global Custom Variable Imports

   #.  Select ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/tools/iar/SIMPLELINK_CC13XX_CC26XX_SDK.custom_argvars``

#. Now you can import `TI Drivers` examples

   #.  Open **Help** -> **Information Center**, and click on
       **Integrates solutions**.
   #.  Go into the Texas Instruments Example projects.

       .. figure:: resources/iar_ti_import_examples.png

           Texas Instruments Example projects

   #.  Click on **example applications**

       .. figure:: resources/iar_ti_list_examples.png

           To go to the list of available ``TI Drivers`` examples

   #.  Click on the **TI-RTOS** link for the ``TI Drivers`` example you want
       to import.

       .. figure:: resources/iar_ti_import_project.png

           Select the project you want to import and specify where you want to
           save it.

#. At this stage, you have imported a new ``TI Drivers`` project.
